# Development roadmap

[GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/outside-labs/projects/1) tracks the
development queue. The [roadmap register](https://github.com/outside-labs/Pretty-Notebook/issues/81) retains the reviewed
planning context, release boundaries, source-idea coverage, and technical
references. Each task issue defines its scope, acceptance criteria, dependencies,
and planned implementation PR. Implementation PRs record the reviewed changes
and verification; current status comes from GitHub.

## Release scope

- **0.10:** 17 required notebook/publishing tasks and 3 optional builder/operations
  tasks. Optional work can move intact to a later release.
- **0.11 proposed:** 9 collaboration tasks and 1 optional packaging task.
- **0.12 proposed:** 4 Markdown-engine tasks with explicit compatibility gates.
- **Later:** 8 follow-on tasks. Later version labels are planning buckets.

The additional 0.10 block introduces the canonical `pretty_notebook` import and
`pretty-notebook` development distribution, compatible `pnbp` imports/CLI, theme
preferences, responsive navigation, coordinated local workers, VPS bundles and
coverage auditing. Its six required child tasks are #145–#150; logging #151 is
queued for 0.11. Retain local SQLite, one owning notebook, trusted editors and a
TLS proxy, with one Gunicorn instance and up to four coordinated workers.
Release publication, hosted deployment, and new external service/provider
decisions have their own authorization boundaries.

## Ordered task index

Use the Project's Order, Target, Status, Depends on, Planned PR, and PR fields
alongside the issue scopes. Adopted tasks become Ready after their dependencies
merge. Proposed work and optional work awaiting selection remain in Triage.
Large tasks can use child issues and focused implementation PRs while retaining
the parent acceptance gate.
