# Building the documentation

The Markdown files in `docs/` are the canonical documentation. Sphinx and MyST
render those same files; generated HTML and doctrees stay in the ignored
`docs/_build/` directory. The development roadmap remains in GitHub Markdown.

The pinned build tools require Python 3.12 or newer. This documentation-only
requirement does not change the package's Python 3.11 runtime support. From a
fresh checkout at the repository root:

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv-docs
.venv-docs/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
.venv-docs/bin/python -m pip install --editable . --requirement docs/requirements.txt
.venv-docs/bin/python -m pip check
.venv-docs/bin/python -m sphinx -b html -n -W --keep-going -E docs docs/_build/html
.venv-docs/bin/python docs/check_html.py docs/_build/html --sources docs
.venv-docs/bin/python -m sphinx -b doctest -n -W --keep-going -E docs docs/_build/doctest
```

On Windows, use `.venv-docs\Scripts\python.exe` for the same commands.
Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` after the build. Rerun the HTML build,
emitted-link check and doctest build after edits. `-E` rebuilds the environment, `-n` checks references, and `-W`
makes warnings fail the build. API reference imports use this checkout's
`src/` directory, while CLI help comes from the actual Click command registry
without running commands.

The emitted-HTML check verifies local file and fragment links, and rejects
source names such as `search.md` that collide with Sphinx's generated search.
The notebook's search guide is `local-search.md`; Sphinx retains `search.html`
for searching the documentation itself. The check's failure cases run with
`python -m unittest discover -s docs/tests`.

The doctest builder executes the local [workflow tutorial](tutorials.md) in a
temporary notebook with isolated settings. Initialization, pending edits,
save/discard, identities, rename/backlink repair, search, navigation/traversal
and route previews are verified. Remote publication examples require a reviewed
running site and credentials; the docs build makes no remote publication requests.

The documentation CI workflow installs only the package and declared docs
requirements, checks dependency compatibility, then runs that strict build.
Add pages to the index's toctree and use local Markdown links between pages;
MyST resolves and checks their heading fragments. Avoid suppressing warnings
to hide missing targets or incorrect public imports.

The prepared `.readthedocs.yaml` uses the same sources, requirements and
warnings-as-errors policy. Hosted project activation, domain configuration and
publication remain separate work requiring authorization. This configuration
does not establish a live hosted documentation URL.
